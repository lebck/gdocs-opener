# Gfiles opener

Gfiles with extensions _.gsheet_, _.gform_, _.gdoc_ are synchronized by Google Drive. When opened, they just open the file in the browser. When I switched to Nexcloud, I copied these files to my new cloud without being able to open them anymore.

I found out that these files just contain json code. So I wrote this short script to open my Google Docs.

**Works only on Mac!**
